In this project, I not only mastered the advanced application of the Axure product prototyping tool but also successfully designed and produced over 30 effective high-fidelity pages, each reaching industry standards in both visual design and user experience. During market research and user experience analysis, I delved deeply into user needs, and based on these insights, I wrote comprehensive requirement documents and competitive analysis reports. These documents provided clear guidance for the project's direction. Additionally, I developed a deep understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design principles. This knowledge helped me make more informed design decisions within the project. Finally, the 1.0 version of the project was successfully launched in 2019 and currently boasts over 300,000 users.
